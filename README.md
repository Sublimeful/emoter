Welcome to emoter, it is an all purpose reaction image organizer!

Simply create a main directory with many subdirectories within it containing your images, for example:

(View in raw mode please)

EMOJIS(Main Directory)
   |
   |__Angry Emojis
   |       |__Angry0.png
   |       |__Angry1.png
   |       |__Angry2.png  
   |__Sad Emojis
   |       |__Sad0.png
   |       |__Sad1.png
   
When you first open the program, you will be greeted with nothing! But don't panic, it is because you have not set your
main directory's path yet, on the top left, click the button labeled "Set Emote Path" and you be greeted with a dialog box where you
can select your main directory!

Once you have selected your main directory and have set up all your pictures. You must RELOAD in order to see all your pictures,
you can do that by typing into the search box or just closing and reopening the program.

Now, you should see all your pictures, you can make them smaller or bigger by holding down SHIFT + [ OR SHIFT + ].

The size of the image determines how big the image will be when you paste it into your desired location.

In order to get the image into your clipboard, you just simply click on the image.

That's all there is to it, have fun!
